Lottery Game : 
Welcome to the Lottery Game repository! This project is a simple lottery game where users can purchase tickets and stand a chance to win by matching a randomly generated 4-digit number.

How It Works : 
When a user purchases a ticket, the game generates a random 4-digit number. If the user's ticket matches the generated number under certain conditions, they win; otherwise, they're encouraged to try again next time.

Game Rules : 
Each ticket purchased generates a unique 4-digit number.
If the user's number matches the generated number and meets specific conditions, they win.
Conditions for winning may vary and are implemented within the code.
Winners are notified with a "Congratulations!" message, while others are encouraged with a "Better luck next time!" message.
